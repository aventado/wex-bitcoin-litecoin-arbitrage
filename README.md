# wex-bitcoin-litecoin-arbitrage

Triangular arbitrage between USD -> BTC -> LTC -> USD

Easily modified for the currencies of your choice

In 2018 this script might make a few cents to a few dollars per day but generally
will not be worth it to run, feel free to fork and use as a base for something else

Known Issues:
- Does not calculate max trade size based on each leg of the trade (must be in and out of each position seamlessly)
- Does not calculate alternative exit strategies (if caught in leg and selling is unprofitable because of a lag in execution, can we move to another pair and get back to USD?)
- Probably more
